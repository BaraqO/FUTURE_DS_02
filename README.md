# IPL PROJECT
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. 
It features teams representing various cities or states of India, competing in a fast-paced, shorter format of cricket that has grown immensely popular worldwide. 
The IPL usually runs annually between March and May, attracting top international and local players, making it one of the richest and most-watched cricket leagues globally.
It blends sports with entertainment, often involving celebrity owners, massive fan followings, and high-profile sponsorships.

## ANALYSIS
In the analysis done we dive into the 2008-2020 IPL seasons to gain insights and draw out knowledge of what might have happened during the seasons.
We get to answer the following:
  1. What team has the most wins from 2008 to 2022?
  2. What team has the most titles during this period?
  3. Which City has held the most matches?
  4. How many players have won at least 1 player of the match?
  5. How have matches been won? (Runs or wickets) -among other insights needed.
